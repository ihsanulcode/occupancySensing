# Camera-Based Occupancy Sensing Using AI for Smart Home Applications

## Description
Since the emergence of modern housing technologies, significant advancements have taken place, driving innovation in alignment with user needs, safety protocols, and other key considerations. A notable example is AI-powered camera-based occupancy detection, which excels at tracking the presence or absence of individuals in homes. Our project leverages cutting-edge Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like ResNet50, MobileNet V3, EfficientNet B0, and MobileNet V2 to create a sophisticated real-time system for occupancy detection.

To build this system, we used a variety of video data from multiple sources, including hospitals and other indoor environments, to thoroughly train the model. Our computational setup was equipped with powerful processors and graphics cards capable of handling complex image processing tasks. We applied advanced optimization techniques to fine-tune our models, significantly enhancing their accuracy and performance.
